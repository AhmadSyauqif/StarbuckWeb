<h1>About Us</h1>
<h2>It happens millions of times each week – a customer receives a drink from a Starbucks barista – but each interaction is unique..</h2>

<p>It’s just a moment in time – just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand.
</p>
<p>But it’s a connection...</p>
<p>We make sure everything we do honors that connection – from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we 
engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.</p>

<p>From our beginnings as a single store over forty years ago, in every place that we’ve been, and every place that we touch, we've tried to make it a little better than we found it. </p>
